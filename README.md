Transformer
🤗 Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pre-trained models can reduce your computing costs, and carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

📝 Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
🖼️ Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
🗣️ Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
🐙 Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

PIPELINE FUNCTION

The pipeline() is the easiest and fastest way to use a pretrained model for inference. You can use the pipeline() out-of-the-box for many tasks across different modalities, some of which are fill mask,question answering, text generation,summarization,sentiment analysis etc.
